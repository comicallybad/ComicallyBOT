Let's just say this bot does everything... including keep a conversation if you enable it's autochat feature :)

SETUP 1:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a discord text channel named "**mod-logs**"
**FOR:** Logging moderator command uses and server events (user join/leave/mute/unmute/kick/ban). 

Create a discord text channel named "**reaction-logs**"
**FOR:** Logging reaction role events (user join/leave role via reaction role) if you wish to log these events separately.

Create a discord text channel named "**reports**"
**FOR:** Logging reports from the `_report` command if you wish to log these events separately.

**NOTE:** These channels **require** the bot to have at least: 
`view channel, send messages, embed links, mentions, and view audit log` permissions.

SETUP 2:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
